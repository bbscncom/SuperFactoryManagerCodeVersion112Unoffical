name "Filtering"

-- basic filtering with limits
EVERY 20 TICKS DO
    INPUT
        5 stone,
        3 iron_ingot,
        cobblestone, -- trailing comma is fine
    FROM a
    OUTPUT TO b
END

-- use an asterisk to fuzzy match
every 20 ticks do
    -- quoted patterns use full regex
    OUTPUT ".*ingot.*" to b

    -- without quotes, "*" gets converted to ".*"
    -- this is shorter, I prefer it
    INPUT *ingot* from a
end

-- you can exclude items too
EVERY 20 TICKS DO
    INPUT *ingot* EXCEPT iron_ingot, gold_ingot FROM a
    INPUT EXCEPT cobblestone FROM z
    OUTPUT 5 EXCEPT copper_ingot TO b
