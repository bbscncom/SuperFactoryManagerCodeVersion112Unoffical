NAME "Round Robin"

EVERY 20 TICKS DO
    -- you probably don't need round robin
    -- instead, try retain!

    INPUT FROM source
    OUTPUT RETAIN 1000 fluid::water TO thingy
    -- don't put more than 1 bucket of water in each block labelled "thingy"


    FORGET

    INPUT RETAIN 5 stone FROM first
    OUTPUT TO second
    -- don't take the last 5 stone
END

-- alternatively, there is some round robin support
-- it will rotate the each time the statement ticks, so it isn't the fastest

EVERY 20 TICKS DO
    INPUT FROM source
    OUTPUT 128 dirt TO dest ROUND ROBIN BY BLOCK
    -- instead of outputting to all blocks labelled "dest"
    -- when this statement executes it will pick only one block
    -- the chosen block rotates each time this statement is executed

    FORGET

    INPUT FROM "storage a", "storage b" ROUND ROBIN BY LABEL
    OUTPUT 8 bone_meal TO EACH dispenser
    -- instead of outputting to all the labels
    -- one label will be chosen each time the statement executes
    -- basically alternating between
    -- INPUT FROM "storage a"
    -- and
    -- INPUT FROM "storage b"
